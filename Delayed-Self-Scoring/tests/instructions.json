After studying all of the items, you will be prompted to recall each definition by typing it into a short answer box. You will then indicate to what degree you think your answer is correct by marking it as 'fully correct,' 'partially correct,' or 'incorrect'. At the end of the experiment, there will be a few final questions for you to answer. Please do not write anything down, do not click the back button on your browser, and do not open other tabs or browsers during the experiment. Thank you for your participation!

You will have to study each term and definition for a minimum of 15 seconds. When 15 seconds is over, you may advance by pressing the 'Continue' button.

  "text": "<font size = 5>In the next part of the experiment, you will be asked to recall the definitions you previously studied. You will see a question on the screen telling you which definition to recall along with a short answer box where you may write your answer. After writing down each defintion, you will be asked to indicate to what degree you think your answer is correct by marking it as 'fully correct,' 'partially correct,' or 'incorrect.' Answers that are fully correct signify responses that are 100% accurate, whereas partially correct responses are those that are between 40% and 99% accurate. If you believe your response is less than 40% accurate, mark it as incorrect. You will have to spend at least 10 seconds trying to recall the definition. You may spend more than 10 seconds recalling if you would like. We realize that this is a difficult task, but try to recall as much of the definition as you can. When 10 seconds is over, you may advance by pressing the 'Continue' button.</font size = 5>"
